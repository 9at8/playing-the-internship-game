I wore whatever
just like school
I wouldn't wear somethign super fancy to school
nor something super revealing cause random strangers would see me and maybe judge me lol
and that translated pretty directly to what people wore at work

and in summertime I've worn short shorts and tank tops and whatever
it's definitely more chill than high school dress code (at least where I've worked)
though also air conditioning can make the buildings cold XD
such a struggle

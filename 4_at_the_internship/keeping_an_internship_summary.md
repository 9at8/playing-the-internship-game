I always keep a log of my internship

things I did that week (all the code changes), nontechnical things I contributed or did (maybe an event I went to or a conversation I had or something), reflections on what I think I did well or could work on and just how I felt about the week (i.e. I felt anxious about x thing I want to work on getting better at y thing) and then I bring all those things to my 1:1 and talk about them and write out a summary of things we talked about and what I want to work on going forward (a section at the end with goals, I think)

it's really nice to see what I've gotten done, be like yes I did do things! aha.
and it's also nice to keep track of all the things I want to work on. have them written down so I can go back later and ask my mentor how I'm doing

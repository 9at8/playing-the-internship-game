### Disclaimer

There are a lot of opinions on resumes. Many of them conflict with each other. Here I'll write about the things I look for when critiquing/writing resumes, but keep in mind it's just my own preference (and I'll try to explain why I feel that way). The main goal of a resume is to advertise yourself as well as possible, so if you feel you can do that better by not following my advice, then go for it.


### Why resumes are important

Even if you're super qualified, if you can't show that on your resume you might not get an interview and then will never get a chance to even talk to someone about why you're a good fit for a job. The resume is one of the first parts of the job hunt funnel so it's very important to take it seriously and make it good. Folks that are hiring often spend only a few seconds looking at your resume, so knowing what they're expecting to see and how to impress them is essential for getting your job.


### Key goals

- Goal: prove you're qualified and would be nice to work with
- How you'll do it:
 - make your resume easy to scan
 - clearly and concisely demonstrate your qualifications


### Show don't tell

As much as possible, don't list your skills without context proving you have them. Anyone can write "good communicator" on their resume, and unless you talk about something you did that needed very good communication skills, that line is essentially useless. Show that you know programming languages by mentioning them in the work you've done with them


### Length

One page is generally considered best, but I've had a two page resume in the past and know plenty of people that have done well with two page resumes. In general, I'd say if you have a two page resume, it should be okay if they only read the first page (i.e. the second page is like "bonus extra stuff about me")

I like the idea of the one page resume because (1) people might not look at it long enough to even see the second page and (2) if you spread out your information accross two pages, you'll probably have less concentration of the good stuff. Pick your best selling points accross the two pages and put just those on one page.


### Sections in your resume

Header

- you don't need your address - only your name, email, and GitHub if you have one)

Work experience

- this should go at the top if you have relevant experience

Education

- where this goes depends on how well known your school is and how much it'll help sell you compared to your other projects
- if you're applying through a school specific application process, everyone has the same education so put it near the bottom because it won't help you stand out

Projects

- if you don't have work experience, work on some small tech projects you can highlight at the top of your resume as proof of your skills
- these don't have to be big or take too long to do! it's totally okay to make something assignment sized that takes less than a week of work, or a few hours on a weekend
- projects are important when you don't have work experience yet, but they're not as essential once you have work experience on your resume **please don't spend all your time on coding projects unless that's just how you like to spend your time**
- if you have a lot of projects, pick your favourite 3-4 for your resume; it might seem like having 7 projects looks impressive but unless they're all super impressive it just looks like filler - quality over quantity

Awards / Scholarships

- if you have any impressive looking awards/scholarships, definitely mention them

Volunteer experience

- this is especially helpful if you have less work experience
- in first year, I volunteered at some CS workshops and put those on my resume

Small section for your other interests

- I like to put that I sing in choirs and involved with certain clubs - it's important to me to have a life outside of CS-y things, and many employers appreicate this too. Some will talk about them a bit during interviews to break the ice!

Note: You don't need these!! think about what skills you have that you can bring to this job, and find the things in your life that most prove you're qualified and figure out the best way to organize those things on your resume. Everyone is different, so everyone has a slightly different resume that will advertise them best.

### How to talk about things

- use action verbs - they help describe the skills you've used, and starting bullet points with them helps keep your descriptions short and powerful - Google "action verbs" to find a bunch of lists of words to use
- add dates when possible - for work experience, projects, volunteering, etc.
- bullet points should be concise and easy to scan, so ideally only one line long and rarely longer than two lines
- if you have more than 4 bullet points for one section, it'll become a big block of text and will become harder to scan as well


### On how old your points can be

Once you're 2 years into university, I'd say don't talk about high school at all unless (1) you have very few things to say about your last two years or (2) your high school accomplishments are extremely impressive


### Formatting

Consistency:

- use periods at the end of bullet points or don't, but don't mix them
- make sure your dates are in the same format (e.g. Aug 2017 or September '17)
- in general, the way you format each section and the way you talk about things should be consistent - this makes it easy to find informatio and to scan your resume

Keep it simple:

The more different formatting styles there are (bold, italics, different text sizes, different fonts, different colours, use of capital letters) the more work your brain does to make sense of it all. Having a few styles is helpful for differentiating headings/bullet points/important words (if you want), but keep it minimal or your resume becomes harder to scan

Make sure you can print your resume:

- margins should be wide enough that things aren't cut off
- if you use colour, make sure it prints clearly enough in black and white


### Link to stuff!

I'm all about hyperlinks everywhere.

If you have projects on GitHub (if you don't, but have proejcts, put them on GitHub!) link to it at the top of your resume, but also link to your project in that section on your resume.

If you've written a blog post about a project, link to it. If you have a website, link to it at the top of your resume. Add your linkedin. Add your email. Make it all clickable! If you worked at a company that has a website, link to that too.

If you really want someone to be able to visit your link, even if they've printed your resume, make a short link (so it's easier to copy out) and explictly paste it in your resume. In other places you can just hyperlink text as bonus information if someone happens to hover over that area.

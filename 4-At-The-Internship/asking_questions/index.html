<h2 id="asking-questions">Asking questions</h2>
<p>Ah, one of the most scary parts of the internship but also probably the most important!</p>
<p>Ask lots of questions! Ask questions! Did I mention yet that you should ask people questions?</p>
<p>Especially at first, since you probably don't know how most things work yet</p>
<h3 id="who-do-you-ask">Who do you ask?</h3>
<p>usually you'd ask your supervisor
but sometimes to the #engineering slack channel or whatever
whoever would know the answer
if you have 1:1s with your supervisor (and if you dont' I'd suggest to try to set them up) you can also ask every week if your questions are too much or not enough and if they're good questions and get advice on that</p>
<h3 id="how-many-questions-is-too-much">How many questions is too much?</h3>
<p>This is a trick question. I don't think there's such thing as too many questions. It's more about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are you asking questions too often?</strong> Some people are happy being asked things all the time, others would rather you acquire a short list and then ask them all at once and only a few times a day (that way they can focus on their own work as well as helping you out)</li>
<li><strong>Are you re-asking questions?</strong> If you asked something before and didn't take note of the answer and are asking again, that's annoying for the people you're asking. Try to keep track of what people are teaching you (write stuff down!) Of course sometimes things will slip your mind, but if you find yourself re-asking a question make sure to write down the answer that time at least</li>
<li><strong>Could you have just Googled it?</strong> Classic problem. Remember, when you ask people questions you're using their time. And they're usually happy to help you if you need the help. But if you could have found the answer easily by Google searching the error message or term you're trying to define or whatever, then you really shouldn't ask. Always look around a bit first. Some questions you can't find answers to on Google but you can find by searching company forums or documentation, so try that too if you know where those are (and if you don't... ask!)</li>
<li><strong>Could you have used standard debugging/code searching tricks to figure it out?</strong> If you don't know these yet, then ask someone to help you. But notice what stategies they use to figure it out. Next time you have a problem, those same strategies might help.</li>
<li><strong>How long will it take for them to answer your question?</strong> This is often unknown. But try to think of how much questions will bother other ppl vs benefit you. Some quick questions are a small amount of time on their part and a huge benefit to your comfort and ability.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="at-what-point-of-trying-to-find-the-answer-should-you-ask">At what point of trying to find the answer should you ask?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I remember an intern telling me once that he'd been stuck on something for a week now and barely made progress, but he didn't want to ask for help. That's ridiculous to me.</li>
<li>If you have no idea how to find the answer (and you've tried to figure it out for a little bit) you should ask. At some point, you're just sitting around and not doing anything at all and that doesn't help anyone</li>
<li>If the problem is stopping you from moving forward and you have no idea what to do next (this is a terrifying thing for me still) - ASK SOMEONE</li>
<li>You should come up with a standard with your supervisor/mentor - often I've been told that if I've been stuck and making no progress for 20-30 minutes, then I should ask for help</li>
<li>One helpful tip I've been given is to write down all the things I tried in those 20-30 minutes, so that when I ask someone for help they both (1) know what I've tried and learned about the problem, so they don't retry those things or refigure out anything (2) know that I've actually given the problem a solid attempt</li>
<li>Remember, the faster you learn what's up and how to do stuff, the more good work you'll do</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-learn-from-the-questions-you-ask">How to learn from the questions you ask</h3>
<p>If you ask good questions and learn from them, you can eventually ask less (or at least, more experienced) questions.</p>
<p>When you don't know how to figure something out and have to ask someone, also ask how they would have found the answer if they were you - maybe you'll learn about some good company resource for answering questions, or learn how to Google something more effectively.</p>
<h3 id="good-things-to-ask-questions-about">Good things to ask questions about</h3>
<p>You're trying to learn two main things (and they overlap):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>how the code works and all the software</p>
<ul>
<li>what tools/technologies are used?</li>
<li>what are the style guidelines? are there standards for how to write pretty code?</li>
<li>how much testing should you add and how is that done?</li>
<li>how fast should you be finishing things? how much of a perfectionist (at the cost of time) should you be?</li>
<li>how does code get from being written to being live in the product?</li>
<li>how are bugs reported?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>how people work</p>
<ul>
<li>what things do they talk about? what are their social norms?</li>
<li>do they talk in person? or over slack?</li>
<li>do they like it quiet? do they like to be undisturbed and only talk at lunch?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that interns often get a lot of love for how they question things and bring in new energy, so don't be afraid to be you and be something different from what everyone else does. ...but there's some balance in that you want people to like you and enjoy working with you. So you want to fit into their social norms but also challenge them <em>shrug</em> :p</p></div>

## Side projects

- if you don't have work experience, work on some small tech projects you can highlight at the top of your resume as proof of your skills
- these don't have to be big or take too long to do! it's totally okay to make something assignment sized that takes less than a week of work, or a few hours on a weekend
- projects are important when you don't have work experience yet, but they're not as essential once you have work experience on your resume **please don't spend all your time on coding projects unless that's just how you like to spend your time**
- if you have a lot of projects, pick your favourite 3-4 for your resume; it might seem like having 7 projects looks impressive but unless they're all super impressive it just looks like filler - quality over quantity


You don’t have to build something crazy fancy complicated. You can create something through a course (like this [Udacity web development course](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253)) or make a game like hangman or build a calculator or whatever else you can think of. You’ll be surprised how complicated “simple projects” can be and how much you can learn. That’s what employers want to see.
